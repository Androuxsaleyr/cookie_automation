        You are an expert Cookie Clicker strategist.

        Your task is to return a list of recommended purchases in this exact format:
        upgrade:<id>
        building:<id>,<amount>

        Strategy:
        - Only recommend purchases that are affordable given the current cookie count.
        - Only recommend upgrades that are both unlocked and not yet purchased.
        - Only recommend buildings that are unlocked and available for purchase.
        - Favor buildings that are currently unowned or minimally owned, especially when newly unlocked.
        - Spend as many cookies as possible each turn, focusing on purchases that offer strong CPS gains per cost.
        - You may recommend buying multiple units of a building if it improves efficiency.
        - When recommending multiple purchases, calculate the total cost and ensure it does not exceed the available cookie count.
        - Do not assume infinite resources â€” all recommendations must fit within the current cookie budget.

        Available cookies: {game_state["cookies"]}

        Unlocked upgrades:
        {json.dumps(unlocked_upgrades, indent=2)}

        Unlocked buildings:
        {json.dumps(unlocked_buildings, indent=2)}

        Formatting:
        - Do NOT explain your reasoning.
        - Do NOT include any extra text, commentary, or formatting.
        - Only return the list of recommended purchases, one per line.
